## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Mohamed, a **Data Scientist & Analyst** who turns raw data into actionable insights. In my first two years of self-education, I completed over `40` data projects. I then tackled several case studies solving real-world business problems, including **A/B testing**, **customer segmentation**, and **sentiment analysis**.

Using tools like **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau**, tailored to business needs, I specialize in:

- **Data Collection:** Extracting data from databases, APIs, web pages, and third-party sources, ensuring completeness, relevancy, and usability.

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Fixing errors, handling outliers, removing duplicates, filling missing values, and standardizing formats for accurate analysis.

- **Data Visualization & Reporting:** Building interactive dashboards and reports to show trends, track key metrics, and uncover insights.

- **A/B Testing & Experimentation:** Running controlled tests to optimize campaigns, features, and user experiences.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Using ML & DL to forecast trends, behaviors, and outcomes with a balance of accuracy and explainability.

- **AI Solutions:** More details coming soon. Stay tuned!
